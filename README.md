Privacy Policy – StyleTransform
Last updated: 30 August 2025

Thank you for choosing StyleTransform (“the App”, “we”, “our”). Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information is touched by the App, how it is processed, and why we do not permanently store any personal data on our own servers.

Information the App Touches
1.1  Photos & Prompts
• The photo you select and the short text prompt you type are sent once to Google Firebase AI so the requested image can be generated.
• This data is held in Firebase memory/storage only long enough to complete the job (maximum 24 hours) and is then automatically deleted by Google’s service.
• We do not retain a copy of your originals or generated images.

1.2  Token Balance
• Your current token count is saved in a SwiftData model that syncs through your private Apple CloudKit container.
• This information lives inside your own iCloud account; we cannot see or edit it.

1.3  Diagnostics (Optional)
• If you have opted in to Apple’s “Share with App Developers” toggle, Apple may send us anonymised crash logs and usage statistics. These reports contain no photos, prompts, or other personal identifiers.

2. How We Use This Information

• To create the image you request.
• To display and update your remaining token balance on your devices.
We do not use the information for advertising, tracking, or profiling.

3. Where Your Data Lives

• Google Firebase AI – temporary processing only; automatic deletion ≤ 24 h.
• Apple CloudKit (private database) – token counter only; under your iCloud account.
• Your device – original and generated images are saved to your device or iCloud Photos only if you choose to do so.

We maintain no permanent servers or databases that store personal data.

4. Your Rights & Choices

Because we do not possess or control long-term copies of your data, the following controls are entirely in your hands:

• Remove photos or generated images at any time from the App or from the Photos app.
• Delete the App to erase local files and the SwiftData store; you can also remove the App’s CloudKit data in iOS Settings ▸ Apple ID ▸ iCloud ▸ Manage Storage.
• Opt out of diagnostics in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Analytics & Improvements ▸ turn off “Share With App Developers”.

If you contact us requesting deletion, we will explain the steps above, because we do not hold any data that we can delete on your behalf.

5. Security

All network traffic is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. Firebase and CloudKit both use encryption at rest and in transit. We have no server infrastructure that stores personal content.

6. Children

StyleTransform is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the App evolves. Any change will appear here and inside the App. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised policy.
